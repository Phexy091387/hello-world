A bit about me,

I was a Medic in the US Army for 9 years. My IQ before joining was 122, after being exposed to several IEDs(improvised explosive device) and a 
gunshot that hit but did not penetrate my helmet, I was given an IQ test to determine the severity of potential brain damage. The resuts were 
actually a growth to a 140 IQ. I laughed and told the doctors that I now know the secret to getting more intelligent, but boy is it dangerous.
